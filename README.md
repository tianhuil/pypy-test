# pypy-test

###
On a fairly beefy Ubuntu System, found that pypy3 was about 40 times fatser than python3.

```
~/pypy-test$ pypy3 test.py
Sum of 1000000 numbers is :  499999500000
Elapsed time is :  0.0026879310607910156  seconds
~/pypy-test$ python3 test.py
Sum of 1000000 numbers is :  499999500000
Elapsed time is :  0.08730697631835938  seconds
